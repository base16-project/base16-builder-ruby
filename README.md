# base16-builder-ruby
This is a work in progress and aims to build a base16 builder as defined by the [base16 builder guidelines](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/builder.md) version 0.8.1

I'm currently just working in a single app.rb file and I'll cleanup the structure and split it into classes once I have all the steps working as defined in the guidelines.
